# asmlist
A linked list implementation written in x86-64 asm.

A simple linked list implementation written primarily in x86 asm. Primarily created to learn and practice asm skills,
and as a point of curiosity to see if a casually hand-written asm linked list would be notably faster than similar code in c and c++.

To compile with a default test driver, type 'make' at the command line.
To create .s files for all c source code, type 'make dump'
